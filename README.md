â”œâ”€â”€ repo-2
â”œâ”€â”€ repo-3
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Example Output
When you have unpushed changes:
```sh
ðŸ™ˆ  Unpushed changes in	/Users/simon/repos/dotfiles/
ðŸ™ˆ  Unpushed changes in	/Users/simon/repos/lazy-reading/
```

When you don't have any unpushed changes:
```sh
No unpushed changes! All is good ðŸ‘Œ
```

replace `[REPO FOLDER]` with an absolute path to your repo folder.
